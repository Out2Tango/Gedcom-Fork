        2) Tags missed from rewrite tests.
        3) Proper tests for missing / corrupted tags on all ged files, can we use a memory stream to avoid writing to the file system?
        4) Plan for iComparable etc on all records, have as a virtual.
        5) Tabbed files, test above.
        6) Ansel Encoding - restore, unit tests.
        7) Name parsing tests according to spec.

        Find all console.writeline, debug.print, debug.* trace.*, diagnostics etc. and ensure we capture them in the parse info logs.
         For example, 'Unknown state / tag parsing'
        Notes are hard work, we need to do lookups by xref instead of just having a list of GedcomNote records attached. Need to fix this as a pain to test and use as well.

        Notes;
        We should implement icomparable<t>/icomparable on objects and replace duff icomparables.
Notes should be attached to individual when not xrefs.
Torture tests http://www.tamurajones.net/ThreeTortureTests.xhtml
Notes have extra lines added
Missing VERS from SOUR as well.
Compare our line count with their line count, should be same ideally.

Individual records need to compare all name elements (Name/surname/given name, notes) plus notes, sources etc for equality.

         * TODO: Tests required for:
         *  All encodings.
         *  Comments from old tests that need recreating:
         *   'File has 24963 INDI, 1 is in a CONT'
         *   'File has 91 INDI, 1 is  HEAD/_SCHEMA/INDI though'
         * The following needs sifting through to see what should fail the date parser,
         * what should pass and what messages should be logged.
         * Some date text has just the month or day, which we don't handle. Find an example of this and figure out how to cope with it.
         * Tests for mixed case months, for example, JuL
